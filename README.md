This addon is a port of the interface from the game S.T.A.L.K.E.R. in Garry's Mod. The addon not only transfers the interface, but also allows you to save its functionality.
The addon has support for custom styles. This means that everyone can create their own style, or try to transfer the interface from any mod to S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
